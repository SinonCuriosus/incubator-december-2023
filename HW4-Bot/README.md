I used "https://ngrok.com/download" to run the bot without issues as it seems that I was unable to run it using the method suggested by Tumul (in his session).
Due that, together with Sandro we raised a ticket: https://github.com/fbradyirl/webex_bot/issues/48; And also Gerard got in touch with Tumul to see if is there any solution.


Regarding the homework.

We will need 2 shells:
    1) One running: "ngrok http 4111"
    2) Other one running: "python webex-bot-ngrok.py"
